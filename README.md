# Data & AI with Forbes

Welcome to **Data and AI with Forbes**, a repository for data and AI topics clearly and simply explained. Each notebook is designed to illustrate key concepts in a simple, hands-on way â€” adequate for learners, professionals, and enthusiasts alike. This project is part of my effort to make technical data and AI concepts more accessible. If youâ€™re interested in simplifying AI, machine learning, and data science, follow along on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardoforbescosta/) and watch this repo for new updates.
